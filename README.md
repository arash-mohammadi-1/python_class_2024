# __hello and welcome to my 2024 python class__

## *In this git file I have put all the assignment that I had wrote and all the class codes.*



## *so I dont know what to say so I will talk about python and how it works :*

python is made of __object oriented programing__ or better know as __oop__.

- __oop__ :
when you pick a word like *(list)* and you gave it a fanction, like if we make a function for list to make list out of what we gave it , it will do that 

- you get my point giving words a meaning 

- if you want to know more about **oop** heres the [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

- and if you want to know more about **python** this is the [link](https://www.w3schools.com/python/).
## code print : 
okey  print is not a very hard code to learn when you write print("the thing that you wanted to print") it will printed .

### Example:
- ### print("Hello world")  ---> Hello world
